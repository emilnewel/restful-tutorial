# RESTFUL-TUTORIAL

This repository is for a turorial I'm following by [Dev Ed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClb90NQQcskPUGDIXsQEz5Q) in order to better understand RESTful API's before I start my last year at Reykjavik University where I will be taking a Web Services course. (ONE YEAR TILL GRADUATION WOOHOO :beers: :fire: )

## About the project
This is an RESTful API which lets the user GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE 'posts' from a database. Currently, it only stores title, description and time of each posts. I wrote an Express server that is connect to a MongoDB cluster where the information is stored. 

## What I used
* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) - Have used this before
* [MongoDB (Mongoose)](https://www.mongodb.com/) - New to this, mongoose is a very simple npm package. Could be useful for small projects in the future. Especially with free clusters from Atlas
* [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) - I'm new to Postman, but will definitely come in handy when writing/testing API's in the future.
* [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) - Just so I don't have to restart the server each time I make a change.
* [Git/Github](https://github.com/) - Obviously.. :sweat_smile:
